Graded B.
Group project where we developed an application that allow residents
of a housing cooperative to upload expenses done on behalf of their housing
cooperative and get reimbursed. A typical use case would be that a resident
is paying for paint for a voluntary repainting of the entrance to the building.

An intuitive and streamlined uploading process collects all the necessary data
in multiple reactive forms and stores it in a state service. That data is used
to generate an expense report that is sent to chosen residents in the housing
cooperation for approval through signing. If all signees approve of the filed
expense report it is sent to accounting for reimbursement.
